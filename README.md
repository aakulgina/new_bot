This repository contains code for a telegram bot which uses fast neural style transfer. The repository was created as a part of a final project for DLSchool.

The idea of fast neural style transfer, as well as several files (mosaic.pth, transformer_net.py), were taken from https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style
